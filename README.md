Backyard Buddy 

This is the Backyard Buddy, a garden designing tool! The Backyard Buddy will first ask a user to take a short survey on what type of climate they live in and what they're looking for in a garden. It will then allow a user to draw the shape of their garden and put in their pre-existing plants. Next, users will be given a catalog of recommended plants that they can drag and drop into their garden. Finally, the user's garden will be ranked on how sustainable it is and how well the plants interact with each other, and the user can save the garden to revisit it later.
